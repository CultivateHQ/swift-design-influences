# Basic Comparison of Swift With Similar Languages

This repository contains the sources for a static website with one page that
compares the Swift language's syntax against others such as Scala, to
see what other languages influenced its design.

## Usage

Install Ruby and the Bundler gem.

Use Bundler to get Ruby dependencies installed:

```
$ bundle install
```

Run the local development version:

```
$ rake server
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/

Output a static copy of the website to `./build`:

```
$ rake
```
